# The mac apps and tools I use (as an iOS developer)
Although transitioning from one MacBook to another is always a great chance to get rid of unused apps and files, these are the essential tools I always take with me. So, take this mostly as a reference for myself. ;) Oh, and I bet I missed a lot here, so this will grow over time.
